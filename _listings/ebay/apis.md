- name: Ebay Get Item Item
  description: This call retrieves the details of a specific item, such as description,
    price, category, all item aspects, condition, return policies, seller feedback
    and score, shipping options, shipping costs, estimated delivery, and other information
    the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. The Buy APIs are designed to let
    you create an eBay shopping experience in your app or website. This means you
    will need to know when something, such as the availability, quantity, etc., has
    changed in any eBay item you are offering. You can do this easily by setting the
    fieldgroups URI parameter. This parameter lets you control what is returned in
    the response. Setting fieldgroups to COMPACT reduces the response to only the
    five fields that you need in order to check if any item detail has changed. Setting
    fieldgroups to PRODUCT, adds additional fields to the default response that return
    information about the product of the item. You can use either COMPACT or PRODUCT
    but not both. For more information, see fieldgroups. Request headers You will
    want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this call. If you are
    an eBay Network Partner you must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId
    in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site and it is
    strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improved the estimated delivery
    window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buy APIs Overview.
    Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.
